            <div class="modal-text">
                <p>This collection was created to preserve the stoic wisdom of antiquity—not to glorify war, but to honor the profound insights born from humanity's darkest hours.</p>
                
                <p>Rome was forged by conflict, yet these quotes transcend mere warfare. They speak to the battles we all face: the struggles within ourselves, the weight of PTSD and trauma, and the daily conflicts that test our resolve.</p>
                
                <p>These words, spoken by philosophers and warriors who stood at history's crossroads, offer timeless guidance. Whether facing external adversity or internal turmoil, their wisdom remains as relevant today as it was millennia ago.</p>
                
                <p>Let us learn from the past to build a future guided by wisdom rather than bitterness, understanding rather than division.</p>
